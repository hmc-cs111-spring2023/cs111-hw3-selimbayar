# Free project 2

## The user and a language

This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.

This project would serve game developers and designers, especially ones with fewer experience in coding and newer to this idea, as it would make game development faster, easier, and more efficient.

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

With this idea, the need of specifying game logic, levels, characters, and any other elements of game designing would be made much easier for developers. I would help people with fewer experience in general-purpose programming languages, as they do not know many things and the complicated things of a GPPL to create the game of their dreams. With this language, their experience would be much easier to create a game as it would reduce the time and effort required to build a game.

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

A DSL is appropriate because it helps game developers create a game without knowing too much of a different language, as it addresses this need by having its own, easier to understand language than a general-purpose programming language. After developers get familiar with this language, they would be able to create games much easier, hence a DSL is appropriate for this area.

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I am very into video games, and also game programming. In fact, I am part of an Esports team in Fifa 23, a video game for soccer. My first experience with coding has actually been with game programming, so I have always dreamt of building my own game. When I first took this class, I instantly thought of this domain, so that is how I came up with this idea.

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

Easier game development and design

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

The user would have to get familiar with this language. It may be similar to a host language, so users with experience with the host language may have an advantage. The programming would, however, have its own syntax that will help ease creating the game logic, levels, etc. I believe this is the right way to interact with this domain because fully knowing a general-purpose programming language to design a game is almost impossible, and may end up with developers not being able to fully execute their dreams. I believe if they fully understand this language, they can do whatever they want in their games.

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

When the program runs, it might run the game, or parts of the game to see how it looks. The program interacts with the user in a way that a normal programming language would interact, where the developer would build functions, classes, and objects as part of their games.

Syntax errors might occur, which the program can show where the mistake was made, and the developer can go back and fix. There can also be logical errors within the game, which the programmer can see themselves while testing and fix later.

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

Building any game should be easy in this language, as that is the main purpose of this DSL. Creating very complex games should be possible but difficult, and generating background images and music should be impossible, as that is not part of the goal, those should be imported externally.

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

I believe there is definitely something similar to this idea. For the first HW, when we were choosing a DSL to present, I instantly looked at video game related DSLs. There was one that I came across, but there was not too much information on it, so I did not write about that. It was called GML (Game Maker Language) and even though there is no official website, this is a link that describes it <https://www.gamedesigning.org/engines/gml/>

GML allows users to finely tune the different aspects of their desired end product, ideally a game with great programming. However, there is not a lot of information about GML to comment enough about it.

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

This would make a good CS111 project, as video game development is always a hard, but very interesting thing for upcoming game developers. This language would help dumb it down for everyone, so it would make a good project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

If someone were to work on this, he/she would spend more time in the language aspect of the project, as the language will be unique, and would need a lot of effort to have a basic but different syntax that everyone would understand. I would say an 80% to 20% compared to the systems aspects of the project, as the main focus is designing the language. 

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

The idea is very big, ultimately a language that every potential and present game developer would use to design games. It is not as ambitious as my first idea because there are similar examples out there that serve the similar needs.

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_

It would be a good project because there would be improved productivity as developers can write code faster and more efficient. There would be increased collaboration as the DSL could help reduce the barriers between different roles in a team, making it easier for developers to work together. Finally, there would be enhanced creativity and quality, as developers can focus on the specific needs of a game rather than the technical implementation details.

However, it might not be a good idea because learning the language itself can take some time and effort, especially for the ones who are familiar with other GPPLs. Also, there might be a smaller audience than a GPPL because it specializes in one thing, so there would be less support and resources.
